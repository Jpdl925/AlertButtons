// Mini Challenge 5 Alert Component

In our Same Project file: Create a re-usable Alert Component

Use bootstrap

Create a simple React component called Alert that is tied to a button and with the button toggle the alert to show and hide. Requirements:

The component should display the Alert message of your choice.
There should be a button labeled "Show" that, when clicked, Will display the Alert.
Inside the Alert there should also be a X to close the Alert.

// Comments: <br>  
* I see that your Alert component works. <br>
* In the App.tsxis relatively simple and has the Alert component call. <br>
* As required, your useState is with your turnery operator so that it can be used.
* I see in your Alert.tsx you have your turnery operator being used named "show".  I like how its inside of your componenet and not in your app.tsx so its more reusable.
